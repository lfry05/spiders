            Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight limbs, chelicerae with fangs generally 
            able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk. They are the largest order of arachnids and 
            rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on 
            every continent except Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat. As of June 2025, 
            53,034 spider species in 136 families have been recorded by taxonomists. However, there has been debate among 
            scientists about how families should be classified, with over 20 different classifications proposed since 1900.
